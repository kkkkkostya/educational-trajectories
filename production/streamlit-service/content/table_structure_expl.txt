The uploaded grade sheet may contain the names of the work in the columns for which the grades are given, student IDs in the first column, and must necessarily contain integer, fractional numbers or blanks in the cells representing the grades.

In addition to the listed cases, the cells must not contain other types of data (for example, categorical). In this case, the work may be unpredictable.

Also, if the separator in the table is not standard (for example, a comma in most file formats), it is highly recommended to specify this separator in the appropriate field.

Example of grade report:

| Student ID | Lesson_1 | Lesson_2 | Semester_1 | Exam |
|------------|----------|----------|------------|------|
| 1          | 5        | 4        | 3          | 4    |
| 2          | 4        | 5        | 4          | 4    |
| 3          | 3        | 2        | 3          | 4    |
| 4          | 4        | 3        | 5          | 5    |
